Explanation of the output

1.Create an Alberta and BC data frame and combine it with the jobs dataset

Given data set already contains the BC and Alberta data, hence it has been removed.
A csv 2states.csv was read and dataframe has been created.
Next, date has been formatted. Library "lubridate" has been used to format the date.
Lastly, a final data frame has been created using the previously created 3 data frames (using column bind for cleaned jobs, 2 states and formatted date).


2.Find the month with the highest total employment across the states.
max() can be used to find the maximum value in a column.
Date and maximum of each province has been calculated using the following command.

Command:

BCmax = max(FinalDataFrame$BC)
View(filter(FinalDataFrame,FinalDataFrame$BC==BCmax)[,c(5,7)]).
.
.
.
and similarly for other provinces.


3.Find the months in which employment figures in Atlantic went below 950.
filter() has been used to find the values less than 950 (as requested)


Command:

View(cbind(FinalDataFrame[,4],FinalDataFrame[FinalDataFrame$Atlantic<950,7]))


4. Sort the figures for Quebec in ascending order
order() has been used while setting the decreasing parameter to FALSE in order to sort the Quebec data in ascending order.

Command:

View(FinalDataFrame[order(FinalDataFrame$Quebec, decreasing = FALSE),])
